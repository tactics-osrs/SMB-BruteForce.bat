# SMB BruteForce

This is a simple script written in Batch that attempts to brute force an SMB connection.

## Description

This script takes an IP address, a username, and a password list as inputs. It then attempts to establish an SMB connection using each password from the list. If the connection is successful, it outputs the password used and terminates. If it fails to establish a connection with any password, it outputs "Password not Found."

## Usage

To use this script, follow these steps:

1. Open a command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the script.
3. Run the script using the command `SMB_BruteForce.bat`.
4. When prompted, enter the target IP address, username.
5. When prompted, either drag&drop or enter the path to your password list.
